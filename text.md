# Gemini Integration Description

AetherGrid leverages the cutting-edge capabilities of **Gemini 3 Pro** to transform renewable energy maintenance from a reactive burden into a predictive, autonomous advantage. Central to the platform is Gemini's **multimodal reasoning**, which seamlessly fuses disparate data streams—analyzing years of historical **SCADA telemetry** alongside high-fidelity **drone inspection footage**. This synthesis allows AetherGrid to detect subtle anomalies, such as micro-cracks or sensor drift, that unimodal systems would miss.

The application heavily utilizes Gemini’s **2-million-token context window** to maintain a deep, persistent understanding of asset history, enabling it to spot long-term degradation patterns across entire wind and solar farms. Furthermore, **function calling** is integral to the system’s agency; Gemini doesn't just observe but acts. It autonomously triggers specialized tools to `analyze_scada_telemetry` for deeper insights, `query_solar_potential` for resource planning, and even `dispatch_repair_crew` with precise inventory requirements based on its diagnosis. By combining these features, AetherGrid creates an autonomous "Site Supervisor" that reduces downtime and optimizes energy yield with minimal human intervention.
